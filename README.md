# Promgramming Problems
This is code examples used to record programming problems.

Programming problems mainly from LeetCode, Codewars and some programming books, the use of C #, Java, JavaScript, Python3 and Golang to achieve programming effect.

If you have a better idea of how to solve problems, please share with us in the issues and share the code with you if you can. 
I hereby express my heart-felt gratitude.

# Problems Description
## Two Sum
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
```
    Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
    Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
    return [0, 1].
```
